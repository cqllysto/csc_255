Bring foods correlated to your specific color Iâ€™ll send some examples. 

Rule of thumb for buying or making the snacks/food it just has to have the color on it whether it be the package or actual food AND bring enough to feed at least 7 people because some of you might bring the same kind of thing. Feel free to collab with people who have the same color!

Let me know if you have any questions!
