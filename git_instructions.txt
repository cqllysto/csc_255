Step 3: Get a working local repo of csc_255

a) Make a GitHub account and send me your name or email associate with your account so I can add your permissions
b) Clone my csc_255 repository onto your Cygwin system (should have git by default) if you're on mac, install git for mac
c) Navigate to the directory in which you want to store our csc_255 folder
d) follow the following commands
git clone https://github.com/cqllysto/csc_255.git

That should make a local version of the master repositiory on GitHub, then you can add, commit, and push your changes as we work together

FINISHED!
Also PS: If this sounds too complicated and you don't want to bother then lmk and we can use like google docs or something lol. I just personally want to use git because it's used professionally for most programming applications and a lot of job descriptions as for it
